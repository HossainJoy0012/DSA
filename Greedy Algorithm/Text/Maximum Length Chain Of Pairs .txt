Problem:
-> Given n pairs of numbers.
   In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number.
-> A pair (c,d) can come after pair (a,b) if b<c.
-> Find the longest chain which can be formed from a given set of pairs.

Solution: (Variation of Activity Selection problem)
-> Sort the pairs in ascending order according to the second value of the pairs.
-> There can't be any overlaping. This means the current pair's second value has to 
   be equal or less than the next pair's first value.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(nlogn)
-> Space: O(n)
