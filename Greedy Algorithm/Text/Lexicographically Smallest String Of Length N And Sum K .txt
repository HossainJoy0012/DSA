Problem:
-> Given two integers N and K.
-> The task is to print the lexicographically smallest string of length N
   consisting of lower-case English alphabets
   such that the sum of the characters of the string equals K
   where ‘a’ = 1, ‘b’ = 2, ‘c’ = 3, ...  and ‘z’ = 26.

Solution:
-> Initialize string of size N and fill all the element with ‘a’
-> Start traversing from the end of the array
   and replace the elements of the array by ‘z’ if K=26
   or replace it by the character having ASCII value (K + 97 – 1).
-> At the same time decrease the value of K by replacing element value 
   i.e. for a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ... z = 26.
-> Also, note that we are subtracting previous element value i.e. (total ‘a’)
   before current element and adding the same before the end of for loop.
-> Check for K < 0 conditions and break the for loop.
-> Return the new string formed by the elements of the char array as the answer.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(n)
-> Space: O(n)
