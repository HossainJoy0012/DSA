Problem:
-> https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-balanced-string-partitions/

Solution:
-> If number of 'L' & 'R' is equal, partitions can be done.
   And the string can't be changed or sorted.
   So we need to iterate through the string
   and in the indices these two become equal a partition can be done.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(n)
-> Space: O(1)
