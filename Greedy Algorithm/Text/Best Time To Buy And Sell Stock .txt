Problem:
-> Given an array prices[] of length n, representing the prices of the stocks on different days.
-> The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days.
-> At most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
-> Stock must be bought before being sold.

Solution:
-> Take two variables which will store the value 0, one indicates a fixed index and another stores answer.
-> If array[current index]>array[fixed index] raverse from 1 to n-1 indices of the array
   while comparing array[current index]-array[fixed index] with the value of answer.
-> Else if array[current index]<array[fixed index] change the value of fixed index with current index.


Complexity:
-> Time: O(n)
-> Space: O(1)
