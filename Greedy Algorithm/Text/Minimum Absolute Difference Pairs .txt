Problem:
-> Given 2 arrays A and B of equal length n.
-> Pair each element of array A to an element in array B,
   such as the sum S of absolute differences of all the pairs is minimum.

Solution:
-> Sort both arrays A and B.
-> Pair the elements of both arrays index-wise.
   Calculate the absolute difference of each pair and calculate their sum.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(nlogn)
-> Space: O(n)
