Problem:
-> Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline.
   There are also given their profits if the job is finished before the deadline.
-> It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time.
   So the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1.
-> Maximize the total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.

Solution:
-> Sort the array in descending order according to the profits.
->
