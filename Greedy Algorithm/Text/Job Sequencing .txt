Problem:
-> Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline.
   There are also given their profits if the job is finished before the deadline.
-> It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time.
   So the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1.
-> Maximize the total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.

Solution:
-> Sort the array in descending order according to the profits.
-> Check if the spent time is lower than the deadline of that job.
   If it is take that job in account and increase the spent time by one
   else skip the job.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(nlogn)
-> Space: O(n)
