Problem:
-> Given two variables L and R, indicating a range of integers from L to R inclusive,
   and a number K, the task is to find Kth largest odd number.
-> If K > number of odd numbers in the range L to R then return 0.

Solution:
-> Here range is l to r (l & r incclusive).
   How many odd numbers lie in this range depend on r.
   If r=even there are (r-l)/2 and if r=odd there are ((r-l)/2)+1
   odd numbers in the range.
-> If the Kth largest odd number is available in this range then,
   if r=even the answer will be r-2*k+1
   else the answer will be r-2*k+2

   Complexity:
-> Time: O(1)
-> Space: O(1)
