Problem:
-> n items are given that are divisible or a fractional part can be taken.
-> Each item's weight and profit/value are given.
-> w, a sack or capacity or weight is given
-> What is the most profit that can be made by filling w with the items from n items?

Solution:
-> Calculate the ratio of profit per weight of the items.
-> Sort the items in descending order according to the ratios.
-> Take the items until whole or 1 of an item can be taken.
   Then take fraction of the next available item.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(nlogn)
-> Space: O(n)
