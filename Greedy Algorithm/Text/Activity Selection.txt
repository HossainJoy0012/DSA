Problem:
-> n activities are given with their starting time and ending time.
-> A person can work only on a single activity at a time.
-> Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by that person.

Solution:
-> Sort the activities in ascending order according to the ending times.
-> As there is no multitasking, the activities that we will take into account
   can't overlap. This means the current activity's end time has to be equal to or
   less than the next one's starting time.

Complexity:
-> Time: O(nlogn)
-> Space: O(n)

**Disjoint set, Maximum meetings in a room -> these 2 problems also use the same logic**
